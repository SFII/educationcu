We are planning to make a "citizen science" style data collection system for the University of Colorado. This will allow students to collect their own data about classes and instructors. The goal is to improve educational data collection at the university and to put students at the center of this effort.

## To be done:
- Data spec (Conner, Justin, Peyman) by 9/3
- React basics (Conner, Justin) by 9/3
